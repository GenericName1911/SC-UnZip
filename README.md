# SC-UnZip

This is a simple decompressor for Supercell's game assets, _specifically_ for CSV and TOML files. The name is self-explanatory, just drag and drop the compressed files onto the tool, and it will decompress them for you. Make sure to run `setup.py` before trying to decompress any files!

The `.pyw` (python no-console) extension should be run using `Python`. It has been used to prevent unnecessary console flashing. Requires Python version >=3.5

## Features:

- The tool is **Cross-Platform**. That is, it works on all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Supports **Batch Conversion**. You can use it to convert multiple files at once.
- **Same Directory** output. The script saves the decompressed files in the same folder as the originals, no matter where you run it from.
- **Open Source**. Licensed under GNU GPLv3.
- **Supported compressions** (from sc-compression):
  - LZMA
  - SC
  - SCLZ
  - SIG
  - ZSTD
